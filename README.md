C++ Windows Socket - Client and Server codes

Baran Kaya

- This is the C++ Windows socket code with WinSock32 library.
- Currently it works as multithreaded messaging application with server and clients.
- Each client send messages to the server and server forwards them.
- I might change this project to basic multiplayer game. That is why it has Map, WaitingRoom, ... classes.
- This project is coded for test&learn purposes.
